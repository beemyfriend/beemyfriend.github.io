<h2>Alone</h2>
<h3>Purpose: Introduction and setup. I was just a guy with idle hands...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In Chile with Family</li>
  <li>My Spanish was so-so at best</li>
  <li>Lived on a farm isolated from the expat community</li>
  <li>Had a lot of freetime</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<h3>Purpose: I started casually learning to code, nothing too serious. It started kind of half-heartedly "coding is probably a marketable skill to have"</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Started with Ruby and Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>My economist friend needed help with a project</li>
  <li>I noticed one of his RAs used R</li>
  <li>Trying to be helpful, I decided I should learn it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tidyverse for the win</h2>
<h3>Purpose: This was the point where I started caring about data. By the time I started learning to program in R, the community had already made useful tools to lower the barrier of entry.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I started learning R around the time the Tidyverse got big</li>
  <li>I slowly transitioned from a person struggling with code to a person having fun with data</li>
  <li>I figured data science was an accessible career path for me</li>
  <li>I went back to the states for the holidays in 2016</li>
  <li>I found a data conference going on at around that time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plotcon|<b>Mind Blown</b></h2>
<h3>Purpose: This was the point where I realized how cool both data viz and data viz people are. This was the moment I realized I wanted to be part of data viz</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I went because they had a day dedicated to R</li>
  <li>Mike Freeman: "people don't remember the numbers they see, but what they felt when they saw them"</li>
  <li>Mollie Pettit & Jess Freaner: "When we brainstorm, we sit down and draw"</li>
  <li>Edward Lee: One of the first data visualizations I wanted to imitate</li>
  <li>Asher Baltzell & Blake Joyce: you don't know big data until you've plotted biology</li>
  <li>Kent Russell: One of the first people I ever collaborated with</li>
  <li>Douglas Duhaime: over at the coffee stand, I told him D3 looks so cool, but everyone says javascript is hard. He replies, it will be a lot easier if you learn SVG first. Things make more sense</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning in Community</h2>
<h3>Purpose: This is the point where I realize how many AWESOME resources there are and how helpful the frontend and D3 community are</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If i'm going to learn D3 I'll need to learn javascript</li>
  <li>freecodecamp doesn't just provide a an online learning interface, but also pushes the concept of a learning community</li>
  <li>Codepen</li>
  <li>finally learned enough javascript to learn D3</li>
  <li>bl.ocks bl.ockbuider</li>
  <li>d3-slack</li>
  <li>Everyone is so different, with such different experiences. we have academics, journalist, frontend devs, artists, GIS. Everyone has an opportunity to learn something new from someoen in the community</li>
  <li>Supportive, sometimes the difference between giving up and keep trying is someone saying good work, you're on the right path, this is really interesting.</li>
  <li>Ian Johnson: "D3 is hard, why be jerks when everyone is already struggling with it?" blockbuilder </li>
  <li>Mike Bostock: already created blocks and is now making things more accessible via observable</li>
</ul>
<h2>I got a job</h2>
<h3>Purpose: I'm no longer just a fan. But now I realize how large and really diverse the field really is.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I got a job in data visualization as a data viz engineer</li>
  <li>I didn't really know what to expect, in hindsight, saying I wanted to work in data viz is as vague as saying I wanted to work in data science</li>
  <li>Data viz is everywhere, because it is everywhere, there is so much to learn and do</li>
  <li>My only recommendation for someone trying to get into data visualization, is narrow it down.</li>
  <li>Carreers in data viz can be found in newsrooms, research labs, consulting firms, banks, cartography companies.</li>
  <li>If you are interested in a particular field, there is almost definitely a need for data viz in that field</li>
  <li>Everyone found their own unique path to the field of data viz. I've created a small write up trying to summarize how people 'do data viz'</li>
</ul>
