Although they ""meet"" only through a series of telephone calls, they grow from being phone sex buddies to caring friends. The play varies from the erotic to emotionally charged moments. ""Jerker"" can be seen as referring to masturbation and to ""tear jerker"".[1][2] Chesley wrote the play because he believed it was ""important to remove the stigma against sex that AIDS has created, and ... to remove the stigma against gay men"".[3]Jerker premiered at the Celebration Theatre on October 24, 1986,[4] under the direction of Michael Kearns and starring David Stebbins and Joe Fraser.[2]Jerker was also performed in London at the Gate Theatre (London) in 1987 under the direction of Stephen Daldry with Set Design by Ian MacNeil (scenic designer) and starring Stevan Rimkus and Anton Horowitz.[5]Jerker has subsequently been considered ""one of the most important pieces of gay theater ever created"".[2]"

The film is a loose adaptation of the book The 120 Days of Sodom by Marquis de Sade. The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian libertines, during the time of the fascist Republic of Salò (1943–1945). The libertines kidnap eighteen teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, and sexual and mental torture. The film explores the themes of political corruption, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality and fascism. The story is in four segments, inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy: the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Shit and the Circle of Blood. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche's 1887 book On the Genealogy of Morality, Ezra Pound's poem The Cantos, and Marcel Proust's novel sequence In Search of Lost Time."
