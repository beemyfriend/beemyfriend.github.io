abn,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abn/index.html,abn: Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks,"Bayesian network analysis is a form of probabilistic  graphical models which derives from empirical data a directed acyclic graph, DAG, describing the dependency structure between  random variables. An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA package which can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>. It is recommended the testing version, which can be downloaded by running: source(""http://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/givemeINLA-testing.R"").

    the mean vector. Within a Bayesian formulation, the elements of
    the mean vector are modelled as having, independently, a

    and a suitable heavy-tailed distribution. The mixing parameter can
    be estimated by a marginal maximum likelihood approach. This leads

        NVIDIA GPUs. This package provides a CUDA implementation of a
        Bayesian multilevel model for the analysis of brain fMRI data.
        A fMRI data set consists of time series of volume data in 4D
        space. Typically, volumes are collected as slices of 64 x 64
        voxels. Analysis of fMRI data often relies on fitting linear
        regression models at each voxel of the brain. The volume of the
        data to be processed, and the type of statistical analysis to
        perform in fMRI analysis, call for high-performance computing
        strategies. In this package, the CUDA programming model uses a
        separate thread for fitting a linear regression model at each
        voxel in parallel. The global statistical model implements a
        Gibbs Sampler for hierarchical linear models with a normal
        prior. This model has been proposed by Rossi, Allenby and
        McCulloch in ‘Bayesian Statistics and Marketing’, Chapter 3,
        and is referred to as ‘rhierLinearModel’ in the R-package
        bayesm. A notebook equipped with a NVIDIA ‘GeForce 8400M GS’

The working model and prior distribution parameters of the dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy relationships can be obtained using early phase adult toxicity and efficacy data at several dose levels through dfped package. Priors are used into the dose finding process through a Bayesian model selection or adaptive priors, to facilitate adjusting the amount of prior information to differences between adults and children. This calibrates the model to adjust for misspecification if the adult and paediatric data are very different. User can use his/her own Bayesian model written in Stan code through the dfped package.

    the otherwise lifeless abyss of your R console! If the syntax is an issue, the

Several PSO variants and controlling options are included to fine-tune the performance of the calibration engine to different calibration problems.

(2011, Statistical Communications in Infectious Diseases) is implemented, with application generally to individual-randomized clinical trials with multiple active treatment groups and a shared control group, and a study endpoint that is a time-to-event endpoint subject to right-censoring. The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing the durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring of each treatment group for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and high efficacy is warranted. The design divides the trial into two stages of time periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first stage of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage two. The package produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics of a specified design including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the different possible trial monitoring outcomes (e.g., stopping early for non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacies; and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the design of studies of the association of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate endpoint problem).

granova,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/granova/index.html,granova: Graphical Analysis of Variance,"This small collection of functions provides what we call elemental graphics for display of anova
    results. The term elemental derives from the fact that each function is aimed at construction of
    graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental 
    questions that drive the particular anova methods. The two main functions are granova.1w 
    (a graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These 
    functions were written to display data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes 
    (however, very large data sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For these two functions 
    a specialized approach is used to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are
    displayed. The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and when appropriate flat surfaces,
    to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect tests in anova. 
    The graphic results are complementary to standard summary tables for these two basic kinds of 
    analysis of variance; numerical summary results of analyses are also provided as side effects.
    Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples), and granova.contr
    (which provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant
    numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data.
    The graphics based on these functions should be especially helpful for learning how the methods have 
    been applied to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be 
    particularly helpful for students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods should be
    quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as they can help to identify
    outliers, clusters or patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear transformations of data. In the case 
    of granova.1w and granova.ds especially, several arguments are provided to facilitate flexibility

ff,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ff/index.html,"ff: memory-efficient storage of large data on disk and fast access
functions","The ff package provides data structures that are stored on
	disk but behave (almost) as if they were in RAM by transparently 
	mapping only a section (pagesize) in main memory - the effective 
	virtual memory consumption per ff object. ff supports R's standard 
	atomic data types 'double', 'logical', 'raw' and 'integer' and 
	non-standard atomic types boolean (1 bit), quad (2 bit unsigned), 
	nibble (4 bit unsigned), byte (1 byte signed with NAs), ubyte (1 byte 
	unsigned), short (2 byte signed with NAs), ushort (2 byte unsigned), 
	single (4 byte float with NAs). For example 'quad' allows efficient 
	storage of genomic data as an 'A','T','G','C' factor. The unsigned 
	types support 'circular' arithmetic. There is also support for 
	close-to-atomic types 'factor', 'ordered', 'POSIXct', 'Date' and 
	custom close-to-atomic types. 
	ff not only has native C-support for vectors, matrices and arrays 
	with flexible dimorder (major column-order, major row-order and 
	generalizations for arrays). There is also a ffdf class not unlike 
	data.frames and import/export filters for csv files.
	ff objects store raw data in binary flat files in native encoding,
	and complement this with metadata stored in R as physical and virtual
	attributes. ff objects have well-defined hybrid copying semantics, 
	which gives rise to certain performance improvements through 
	virtualization. ff objects can be stored and reopened across R 
	sessions. ff files can be shared by multiple ff R objects 
	(using different data en/de-coding schemes) in the same process 
	or from multiple R processes to exploit parallelism. A wide choice of 
	finalizer options allows to work with 'permanent' files as well as 
	creating/removing 'temporary' ff files completely transparent to the 
	user. On certain OS/Filesystem combinations, creating the ff files
	works without notable delay thanks to using sparse file allocation.
	Several access optimization techniques such as Hybrid Index 
	Preprocessing and Virtualization are implemented to achieve good 
	performance even with large datasets, for example virtual matrix 
	transpose without touching a single byte on disk. Further, to reduce 
	disk I/O, 'logicals' and non-standard data types get stored native and 
	compact on binary flat files i.e. logicals take up exactly 2 bits to 
	represent TRUE, FALSE and NA. 
	Beyond basic access functions, the ff package also provides 
	compatibility functions that facilitate writing code for ff and ram 
	objects and support for batch processing on ff objects (e.g. as.ram, 
	as.ff, ffapply). ff interfaces closely with functionality from package 
	'bit': chunked looping, fast bit operations and coercions between 
	different objects that can store subscript information ('bit', 
	'bitwhich', ff 'boolean', ri range index, hi hybrid index). This allows
	to work interactively with selections of large datasets and quickly 
	modify selection criteria. 
	Further high-performance enhancements can be made available upon request.","Daniel Adler,

Moreover, it allows to construct an FRBS model defined by human experts. 
    FRBSs are based on the concept of fuzzy sets, proposed by Zadeh in 1965, which aims at
    representing the reasoning of human experts in a set of IF-THEN rules, to
    handle real-life problems in, e.g., control, prediction and inference, data
    mining, bioinformatics data processing, and robotics. FRBSs are also known
    as fuzzy inference systems and fuzzy models. During the modeling of an
    FRBS, there are two important steps that need to be conducted: structure
    identification and parameter estimation. Nowadays, there exists a wide
    variety of algorithms to generate fuzzy IF-THEN rules automatically from
    numerical data, covering both steps. Approaches that have been used in the
    past are, e.g., heuristic procedures, neuro-fuzzy techniques, clustering
    methods, genetic algorithms, squares methods, etc. Furthermore, in this
    version we provide a universal framework named 'frbsPMML', which is adopted
    from the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), for representing FRBS
    models. PMML is an XML-based language to provide a standard for describing
    models produced by data mining and machine learning algorithms. Therefore,
    we are allowed to export and import an FRBS model to/from 'frbsPMML'.
    Finally, this package aims to implement the most widely used standard
    procedures, thus offering a standard package for FRBS modeling to the R

    as a sophisticated mathematical tool to
    model and process imprecise or incomplete information. By using
    the indiscernibility relation for objects/instances, RST does not require
    additional parameters to analyze the data. FRST is an extension of RST. The
    FRST combines concepts of vagueness and indiscernibility that are expressed

  Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be

  values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the

  build and evaluate models, and export models as PMML (predictive
  modelling markup language) or as scores. All of this with knowing little 
  about R. All R commands are logged and commented through the log tab. Thus they
  are available to the user as a script file or as an aide for the user to 
  learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into R itself. 
  Rattle also exports a number of utility

It contains three functions. The gmeta() function unifies all standard meta-analysis methods and also several newly developed ones under a framework of combining confidence distributions (CDs). Specifically, the package can perform classical p-value combination methods (such as methods of Fisher, Stouffer, Tippett, etc.), fit meta-analysis fixed-effect and random-effects models, and synthesizes 2x2 tables. Furthermore, it can perform robust meta-analysis, which provides protection against model-misspecifications, and limits the impact of any unknown outlying studies. In addition, the package implements two exact meta-analysis methods from synthesizing 2x2 tables with rare events (e.g., zero total event). The np.gmeta() function summarizes information obtained from multiple studies and makes inference for study-level parameters with no distributional assumption. Specifically, it can construct confidence intervals for unknown, fixed study-level parameters via confidence distribution. Furthermore, it can perform  estimation via asymptotic confidence distribution whether tie or near tie condition exist or not. The plot.gmeta() function to visualize individual and combined CDs through extended forest plots is also available.

Similar research questions are studied in different laboratories, using different methods, instruments, and samples. Classic meta-analysis lacks the power to assess more than a handful of univariate moderators, or to investigate interactions between moderators, and non-linear effects. MetaForest, by contrast, has substantial power to explore heterogeneity in meta-analysis. It can identify important moderators from a larger set of potential candidates, even with as little as 20 studies (Van Lissa, in preparation). This is an appealing quality, because many meta-analyses have small sample sizes.

2007;4(3):245-53","I adapted a method designed by Ioannidis and Trikalinos, which
    compares the observed number of positive studies in a meta-analysis with
    the expected number, if the summary measure of effect, averaged over the
    individual studies, were assumed true. Excess in the observed number of
    positive studies, compared to the expected, is taken as evidence of
    publication bias. The observed number of positive studies, at a given level
    for statistical significance, is calculated by applying Fisher's exact test
    to the reported 2x2 table data of each constituent study, doubling the
    Fisher one-sided P-value to make a two-sided test. The corresponding
    expected number of positive studies was obtained by summing the statistical
    powers of each study. The statistical power depended on a given measure of
    effect which, here, was the pooled odds ratio of the meta-analysis was
    used. By simulating each constituent study, with the given odds ratio, and
    the same number of treated and non-treated as in the real study, the power
    of the study is estimated as the proportion of simulated studies that are
    positive, again by a Fisher's exact test. The simulated number of events in
    the treated and untreated groups was done with binomial sampling. In the
    untreated group, the binomial proportion was the percentage of actual
    events reported in the study and, in the treated group, the binomial
    sampling proportion was the untreated percentage multiplied by the risk
    ratio which was derived from the assumed common odds ratio. The statistical
    significance for judging a positive study may be varied and large
    differences between expected and observed number of positive studies around
    the level of 0.05 significance constitutes evidence of publication bias.
    The difference between the observed and expected is tested by chi-square. A
    chi-square test P-value for the difference below 0.05 is suggestive of
    publication bias, however, a less stringent level of 0.1 is often used in

One way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distributions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparametric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear & Begg (1992). The new approach potentially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear & Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).",Kaspar Rufibach,MetaAnalysis

Afterwards, maximum likelihood techniques are used to impute the expected effect size of each study with NSUEs, accounting for between-study heterogeneity and potential covariates. Multiple imputations of the NSUEs are then randomly created based on the expected value, variance and statistical significance bounds. Finally, a restricted-maximum likelihood random-effects meta-analysis is separately conducted for each set of imputations, and estimations from these meta-analyses are pooled.

    The M statistic aggregates heterogeneity information across multiple
    variants to, identify systematic heterogeneity patterns and their direction
    of effect in meta-analysis. It's primary use is to identify outlier studies,
    which either show ""null"" effects or consistently show stronger or weaker
    genetic effects than average across, the panel of variants examined in a
    GWAS meta-analysis. In contrast to conventional heterogeneity metrics
    (Q-statistic, I-squared and tau-squared) which measure random heterogeneity
    at individual variants, M measures systematic (non-random)
    heterogeneity across multiple independently associated variants. Systematic
    heterogeneity can arise in a meta-analysis due to differences in the study
    characteristics of participating studies. Some of the differences may
    include: ancestry, allele frequencies, phenotype definition, age-of-disease
    onset, family-history, gender, linkage disequilibrium and quality control
    thresholds. See <https://magosil86.github.io/getmstatistic/> for statistical

	economic, and health outcomes. Generally, communities are sampled from 
	subpopulations (strata) in a first stage, and then households are listed and 
	sampled in a second stage. In this typical two-stage design, sampled communities 
	are the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and households are the Secondary Sampling 
	Units (SSUs). Census data typically serve as the sample frame from which PSUs 
	are selected. However, if census data are outdated inaccurate, or too 
	geographically course, gridded population data (such as <http://www.worldpop.org.uk>) 
	can be used as a sample frame instead. GridSample generates PSUs from gridded 
	population data according to user-specified complex survey design characteristics 
	and household sample size. In gridded population sampling, like census sampling, 
	PSUs are selected within each stratum using a serpentine sampling method, and can 
	be oversampled in urban or rural areas to ensure a minimum sample size in each of 
	these important sub-domains. Furthermore, because grid cells are uniform in size 
	and shape, gridded population sampling allows for samples to be representative of
	both the population and of space, which is not possible with a census sample frame.","Dana R. Thomson (University of Southampton), Nick W. Ruktanonchai

Analysis in R Scripts","BioGeoBEARS allows probabilistic inference of both historical biogeography (ancestral geographic ranges on a phylogeny) as well as comparison of different models of range evolution.  It reproduces the model available in LAGRANGE (Ree and Smith 2008), as well as making available numerous additional models. For example, LAGRANGE as typically run has two free parameters, d (dispersal rate, i.e. the rate of range addition along a phylogenetic branch) and e (extinction rate, really the rate of local range loss along a phylogenetic branch). LAGRANGE also has a fixed cladogenic model which gives equal probability to a number of allowed range inheritance events, e.g.: (1) vicariance, (2) a new species starts in a subset of the ancestral range, (3) the ancestral range is copied to both species; in all cases, at least one species must have a starting range of size 1.  LAGRANGE assigns equal probability to each of these events, and zero probability to other events.  BioGeoBEARS adds an additional cladogenic event: founder-event speciation (the new species jumps to a range outside of the ancestral range), and also allows the relative weighting of the different sorts of events to be made into free parameters, allowing optimization and standard model choice procedures to pick the best model. The relative probability of different descendent range sizes is also parameterized and thus can also be specified or estimated.  The flexibility available in BioGeoBEARS also enables the natural incorporation of (1) imperfect detection of geographic ranges in the tips, and (2) inclusion of fossil geographic range data, when the fossils are tips on the phylogeny. Bayesian analysis has been implemented through use of the ""LaplacesDemon"" package, however this package is now maintained off of CRAN, so its usage is not formally included in BioGeoBEARS at the current time.

Rates may change (1) as a function of time, i.e. rate shifts at specified times or mass extinction events (likelihood implemented as LikShifts, optimization as bd.shifts.optim and visualized as bd.shifts.plot) or (2) as a function of the number of species, i.e. density-dependence (likelihood implemented as LikDD and optimization as bd.densdep.optim) or (3) extinction rate may be a function of species age (likelihood implemented as LikAge and optimization as bd.age.optim.matlab). Note that the methods take into account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the ""pull of the present"" effect. (1-3) can take into account incomplete species sampling, as long as each species has the same probability of being sampled. For a given phylogeny on higher taxa (i.e. all but one species per taxa are missing), where the number of species is known within each higher taxa, speciation and extinction rates can be estimated under model (1) (implemented within LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim with groups !=0). (ii) For a given phylogeny with sequentially sampled tips, e.g. a virus phylogeny, rates can be estimated under a model where rates vary across time using bdsky.stt.optim based on likelihood LikShiftsSTT (extending LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim).

When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa().

Principle 1 determines all sensible univariate relationships in the spirit of the Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of variables, including predictors and the final outcome variable, is determined with the Markovian property that the value of the current predictor is sufficient in relating to the next level variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific value of the preceding-level variables to the current predictor, given the current value. Principle 2 resembles the multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship of the first-level predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc) to the outcome variable (such as, module degradation or yellowing)  is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each significant intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome variable and the other variables (except the final outcome variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This fitting process is continued until all sensible models are investigated.","Junheng Ma, Nicholas Wheeler, Yifan Xu, Wenyu Du, Abdulkerim Gok, Jiayang Sun",Psychometrics

    are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
    later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's

    time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
    refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the ""Microsoft R Archived Network""

Functions rstring() and rcat() make it easy to process RSP strings, rsource() sources an RSP file as it was an R script, while rfile() compiles it (even online) into its final output format, e.g. rfile('report.tex.rsp') generates 'report.pdf' and rfile('report.md.rsp') generates 'report.html'.

Also supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-time point patterns in any number of dimensions, point patterns on a linear network, and patterns of other geometrical objects. Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel images. 
	Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference. 
	Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and linear networks. 
	Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.
	Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. 
	A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above.
	Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.","Adrian Baddeley,

The package further allows combining the resulting spatially weighted context data with individual-level predictor and outcome variables, for the purposes of multilevel modelling. An ad hoc stratified bootstrap resampling procedure generates robust point estimates for multilevel regression coefficients and model fit indicators, and computes confidence intervals adjusted for measurement dependency and measurement error of aggregate estimates. As an additional feature, residual and explained spatial dependency can be estimated for the tested models.","Till Junge [aut, cre],

Approach","Functionality for spatio-temporal modeling of large data sets is provided. A Gaussian process in space and time is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process. In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous. This package aims at providing tools for two different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero. Covariates can be included in the model through a regression term.","Fabio Sigrist, Hans R.

        1) A shared frailty model (with gamma or log-normal frailty distribution) and Cox proportional hazard model. Clustered and recurrent survival times can be studied.
        2) Additive frailty models for proportional hazard models with two correlated random effects (intercept random effect with random slope).
        3) Nested frailty models for hierarchically clustered data (with 2 levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma random effects.
        4) Joint frailty models in the context of the joint modelling for recurrent events with terminal event for clustered data or not. A joint frailty model for two semi-competing risks and clustered data is also proposed.
		5) Joint general frailty models in the context of the joint modelling for recurrent events with terminal event data with two independent frailty terms.
		6) Joint Nested frailty models in the context of the joint modelling for recurrent events with terminal event, for hierarchically clustered data (with two levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma random effects.
		7) Multivariate joint frailty models for two types of recurrent events and a terminal event.
		8) Joint models for longitudinal data and a terminal event.
		9) Trivariate joint models for longitudinal data, recurrent events and a terminal event. 
		Prediction values are available (for a terminal event or for a new recurrent event). Left-truncated (not for Joint model), right-censored data, interval-censored data (only for Cox proportional hazard and shared frailty model) and strata are allowed. In each model, the random effects have the gamma or normal distribution. Now, you can also consider time-varying covariates effects in Cox, shared and joint frailty models (1-5). The package includes concordance measures for Cox proportional hazards models and for shared frailty models.","Virginie Rondeau, Juan R. Gonzalez, Yassin Mazroui, Audrey

	The approach proposed by Gonzalo and Granger, also known as

cointReg,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cointReg/index.html,cointReg: Parameter Estimation and Inference in a Cointegrating Regression,"Cointegration methods are widely used in empirical macroeconomics
    and empirical finance. It is well known that in a cointegrating
    regression the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the
    parameters is super-consistent, i.e. converges at rate equal to the
    sample size T. When the regressors are endogenous, the limiting
    distribution of the OLS estimator is contaminated by so-called second
    order bias terms, see e.g. Phillips and Hansen (1990) <doi:10.2307/2297545>.
    The presence of these bias terms renders inference difficult. Consequently,
    several modifications to OLS that lead to zero mean Gaussian mixture
    limiting distributions have been proposed, which in turn make
    standard asymptotic inference feasible. These methods include
    the fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) approach of Phillips and Hansen
    (1990) <doi:10.2307/2297545>, the dynamic OLS (D-OLS) approach of Phillips
    and Loretan (1991) <doi:10.2307/2298004>, Saikkonen (1991)
    <doi:10.1017/S0266466600004217> and Stock and Watson (1993)
    <doi:10.2307/2951763> and the new estimation approach called integrated
    modified OLS (IM-OLS) of Vogelsang and Wagner (2014)
    <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.10.015>. The latter is based on an augmented
    partial sum (integration) transformation of the regression model. IM-OLS is
    similar in spirit to the FM- and D-OLS approaches, with the key difference
    that it does not require estimation of long run variance matrices and avoids
    the need to choose tuning parameters (kernels, bandwidths, lags). However,
    inference does require that a long run variance be scaled out.
    This package provides functions for the parameter estimation and inference
    with all three modified OLS approaches. That includes the automatic
    bandwidth selection approaches of Andrews (1991) <doi:10.2307/2938229> and
    of Newey and West (1994) <doi:10.2307/2297912> as well as the calculation of

The methods used for structural specification include Kronecker indices and Scalar Component Models.  (b) For multivariate volatility modeling, the MTS package handles several commonly used models, including multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average volatility, Cholesky decomposition volatility models, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models, copula-based volatility models, and low-dimensional BEKK models. The package also considers multiple tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, including rank-based statistics.

For example, it is not necessary to assume that bottom-level forecasts are unbiased, and aggregate forecasts may be constructed by regressing both on bottom-level forecasts and on other covariates that may only be available at the aggregate level.","Jairo Cugliari, Tim van Erven",TimeSeries

The package produces their maximum likelihood estimates and asymptotic uncertainties using a global optimizer called the differential evolution algorithm. It also produces their posterior distributions via Metropolis within a Gibbs sampler equipped with adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo for posterior sampling. These fitting procedures, however, may produce numerical errors if p>2.

    which are used by other graphical modelling packages, in particular
    by the packages 'gRain', 'gRim' and 'gRc'.
    'gRbase' contains several data sets relevant for use in connection with
    graphical models. Almost all data sets used in the book Graphical
    Models with R (2012) are contained in 'gRbase'.
    'gRbase' implements several graph algorithms (based mainly on
    representing graphs as adjacency matrices - either in the form
    of a standard matrix or a sparse matrix). Some graph
    algorithms are:
    (i) maximum cardinality search (for marked and unmarked graphs).
    (ii) moralize.
    (iii) triangulate.
    (iv) junction tree.
    'gRbase' facilitates array operations,
    'gRbase' implements functions for testing for conditional independence.
    'gRbase' illustrates how hierarchical log-linear models may be
    implemented and describes concept of graphical meta
    data. These features, however, are not maintained anymore and
    remains in 'gRbase' only because there exists a paper describing
    these facilities: A Common Platform for Graphical Models in R:
    The 'gRbase' Package, Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 14,
    No 17, 2005.

huge,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/huge/index.html,huge: High-Dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation,"Provides a general framework for

        preprocessing stage, the nonparanormal(npn) transformation is
        applied to help relax the normality assumption. In the graph
        estimation stage, the graph structure is estimated by
        Meinshausen-Buhlmann graph estimation or the graphical lasso,
        and both methods can be further accelerated by the lossy
        screening rule preselecting the neighborhood of each variable
        by correlation thresholding. We target on high-dimensional data
        analysis usually d >> n, and the computation is
        memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. We also
        provide a computationally efficient approach, correlation
        thresholding graph estimation. Three
