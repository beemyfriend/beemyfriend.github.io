  var intro1 = 'Welcome to RainbowR, a community of R enthusiasts who identify as LGBTQ+. RainbowR seeks to cultivate a safe space for its members to discuss R and all things related to R. Part of cultivating a safe space is by promoting a positive ethos, discouraging harassment and providing a system where harassment can be reported and addressed. Therefore, before we take you to the sign-up page for the RainbowR slack team, we ask you to read through and agree to the following Code of Conduct.<br><br>While most people would agree that harassment is wrong,  there is no clear consensus of what actions consist of harassment. This document does not intend to list every possible instance of harassment, but does take the stance that if a person feels that they are being harassed, then the harassment exists. The only exceptions to this are that we will not address complaints of reverse-isms such as reverse sexism, ‘reverse racism, and cisphobia. We will also not police tone.<br><br>Instead of providing a long list of what can be defined as harassment, we provide a list of ‘Hard and Fast Rules,  provide the contact information of the CoC Team to report instances of harassment, as well as provide a description of how the CoC Team plans on dealing with reports of harassment.';

  var behave1 = '<b>Hard and Fast Rules:</b><br>Do not reveal a person\'s private information or expose private conversations to people who are not members of the RainbowR Slack group.<br><br>Be respectful of communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”<br><br>Do not intentionally refer to people in a way that rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance, by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).<br><br>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour will not be accepted.<br><br>We will not tolerate racist, sexist, or transphobic conduct.<br><br><b>Impact Vs. Intent</b><br><br><br>If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow useRs comfortable.';

  var report1 = 'If you are experiencing abusive or harassing behavior, then report the issue by emailing the RainbowR CoC Team at: rlgbtq@gmail.com<br><br>You can also directly contact any member of the RainbowR CoC Team:<br><br><b>CoC Team Member</b> | <b>Slack Handle</b><br> Elected member\'s name | @elected_member_username<br>Elected member\'s name | @elected_member_username<br>Elected member\'s name | @elected_member_username';

  var conseq1 = '<b>If a complaint of a member\'s actions reaches the RainbowR CoC Team, then they will judge the action based on:</b><br><br>Whether the member was given a proper explanation as to why he or she was being offensive.<br><br>Whether the member provided a proper apology.<br><br>Whether the member\'s action can be considered Trolling.<br><br><b>If the member\'s actions were deemed offensive then:</b><br><br>If the action was considered trolling, then the member will be booted from the group immediately.<br><br>Otherwise the member will be subject to the 3-Strike Rule:<br><br><b>First occurance:</b> The member will receive a friendly, but public, reminder that the behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.<br><b>Second occurrence:</b> The member will receive a private message with a warning that any additional violations will result in removal from the community.<br><b>Third occurrence:</b> Depending on the violation, we might need to delete or ban your account.<br><br>If you have any questions with regards to how the RainbowR CoC Team handles reports of abuse, then please email them at: rlgbtq@gmail.com';
