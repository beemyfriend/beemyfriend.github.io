Practical Application: Keyphrases
=========

**<h5>When people think of graphs, they often think about mapping out social media connections. While graphs are indeed useful for mapping out social networks, they have many other practical applications. Data in the real world resemble vertices and edges more than they resemble rows and columns. This allows researchers to intuitively grasp the data modeled and stored within a graph. Graph exploration -- also known as graph traversal -- is traditionally done with a traversal language such as Gremlin or Cypher. The functionality of these traversal languages can be duplicated by combining the igraph and magrittr packages. Traversing a graph in R gives useRs access to a myriad of simple, but powerful algorithms to explore their data sets. This talk will show why data should be explored as a graph as well as show how a graph can be traversed in R. I will do this by going through a survey of different graph traversal techniques and by showing the code patterns necessary for each of those techniques.</h5>**
